    "# Part 2: Problem Statement, EDA and Dataset ( Wednesday July 8th, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessary Deliverables / Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials must be presented in a Jupyter Notebook stored within a repository on your personal (not GA) GitHub. Please submit a link to this repository by the due date (submission link).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Project Chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will be revenue prediction model on video gaming and doing analysis on which gaming platform  generates the most revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will using SARIMA time-series prediction model in predicting the revenue, model performance will be guided by Mean Square Error. The model should at least improve upon baseline by 10%. Baseline is defined as the revenue generated from Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo from 2008 - 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game developers will be interested in my prediction so that they can better understand how much revenue can be generated through various gaming platform and set a suitable amount of budget for future game developement. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement \n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of mobile games gaining overall market share for gaming industry for around 3% - 7% per year since 2012, the video gaming industry has undergo a decrease in market share especially when there are more free-to-play mobile games which is attracting alot of gamers to play them and switch over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through my prediction model for overall gaming revenues (excluding mobile games), game developers to understand how much is the possible revenue for the video game industry in the future years and set aside the right budget for developing games in order not to go bust. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, by identifying which are the top revenue generating platforms between Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo, game developers can explore the possiblity of developing games that involves cross-platform gaming such as Call of Duty which is available on PC, PS4 and Xbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the following as you perform your initial EDA.\n",
    "Identify the data types you are working with.\n",
    "Examine the distributions of your data, numerically and/or visually.\n",
    "Identify outliers.\n",
    "Identify missing data and look for patterns of missing data.\n",
    "Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be performing EDA based on features like, the total sales of each game title, the most popular genre of games which has generate the most of the sales gobally, identifying which platforms gave the highest sale volume globally through visualisation and summarizing my preliminary findings through the dataset. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Modeling to date\n",

    "### Goal of Predictive Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Revises initial goals & success criteria, as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal of this predictive model is to provide an insight for game developers on what is the projected revenue for the video gaming industry (except mobile games) and also focus on the top gaming platforms that generates the most revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance will be guided by Mean Square Error. The model should at least improve upon baseline by 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "With the predicted revenue from my model, game developer companies will be able to better manage their cost in games development and focus on the gaming platform they are targeting while minimising cost. \n",

    "###  Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be found on this website: https://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/\n",
    "Scrapping data will be saved as .CSV files.\n",
    "There might be some missing values since this is an independent gaming website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in the dataset are as follows:<br>\n",
    "Id - A unique ID for each game in the dataset\n",
    "NA_Sales - Game sales in North America (in millions of units)\n",
    "Platform - Console on which the game is running\n",
    "Year_of_Release - Year the game was released\n",
    "Genre - Game category\n",
    "Publisher - Publisher\n",
    "JP_Sales - Game sales in Japan (in millions of units)\n",
